# Install Application Single Sign-On

The AppSSO package is currently published as part of the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

ðŸ‘‰ If you are already running TAP with `run`, `iterate`, or `full` profiles, AppSSO is installed already. However, you
may want to review its configuration.

* The `appsso` Namespace with a Deployment of the AppSSO controller and Services for Webhooks
* A `ServiceAccount` with RBAC outlined in detail [here](./rbac.md)
