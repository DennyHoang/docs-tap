# Create a Workload from the Supply Chain

This topic covers how to create and apply a workload from a Tanzu Supply Chain, how to observe a
workload, and how to verify the scanning performed in a workload.

## <a id="create-and-apply-workload"></a> Create and apply workload

This sections covers how to create a workload from an existing [supply chain created in the previous page](./create-supply-chain-with-app-scanning.hbs.md) that was created using SCST - Scan 2.0 and with
either the Trivy Supply Chain Component or Customized Scanning Component.

1. Use the Tanzu Cartographer plug-in to create a workload from a specific supply chain:

    ```console
    tanzu cartographer workload generate
    ```

    Example output:

    ```console
    $ tanzu cartographer workload generate

    ? Select the supply chain:   [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
    > SCANNER-supply-chain-1.0.0 (11h)
      trivy-supply-chain-1.0.0 (3d)
    kind: Sample
    apiVersion: sample.com/v1alpha1
    metadata:
      name: example-sample
    spec:
      registry:
        ...
      scanning:
        ...
    ```

    Here the user can create a supply chain workload from the:

    - [Trivy Supply Chain](./create-supply-chain-with-app-scanning.hbs.md#create-supply-chain-with-scst---scan-20-and-trivy-supply-chain-component)
    - [Supply Chain with Customized Scanning Component](./create-supply-chain-with-app-scanning.hbs.md#create-supply-chain-with-scst---scan-20-and-custom-scanning-component)

    This renders a sample workload YAML that you can configure and put in a `workload.yaml`.

2. Apply workload:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f workload.yaml -n DEV-NAMESPACE
    ```

## <a id="observe-workload"></a> Observe workload

This section shows how to use the Tanzu Cartographer CLI to observe a workload.

1. List workloads in cluster:

    ```console
    tanzu cartographer workload list
    ```

    Example output:

    ```console
    $ tanzu cartographer workload list

    NAME                           NAMESPACE                   SUPPLY CHAIN                LATEST RUN                                  READY        AGE   MESSAGE                                     PROGRESS
    Sample/golang-app-test-123     grype-app-scanning-catalog  sample-supply-chain-1.0.0   SampleRun/golang-app-test-123-run-ccmrq     Running      2m4s  waiting for stage buildpack-build & 1 more  ##-
    Example/golang-app-test-456    grype-app-scanning-catalog  example-supply-chain-1.0.0  ExampleRun/golang-app-test-456-run-m4vb9    Not          33h                      ...
    ```

2. View logs for a specific workload:

    ```console
    tanzu cartographer workload tail Sample WORKLOAD-NAME
    ```

    Where `WORKLOAD-NAME` is the name of the workload for a specific Kind defined from the supply chain.

3. View workload details:

    ```console
    tanzu cartographer workload get Sample WORKLOAD-NAME
    ```

    * See [Tanzu Supply Chain docs](../../supply-chain/development/how-to/observe-runs.hbs.md) for more
    details on how to observe runs of the workload.

## <a id="verify-workload-scanning"></a>Verify workload performed scanning by checking scan results

1. Get the ivs name by looking for the IVS in the namespace it was created in:

    ```console
    $ kubectl get ivs -n DEV-NAMESPACE

    NAMESPACE                    NAME                          SUCCEEDED   REASON      AGE
    DEV-NAMESPACE                golang-app-test-123-bbrpz     True        Succeeded   4m52s
    ```

    * For information on how to retrieve scan results by using the IVS name found in the previous step, see [Retrieve scan results](../verify-app-scanning.hbs.md#retrieve-scan-results).
