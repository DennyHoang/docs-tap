# Tanzu Supply Chain API

{{> 'partials/supply-chain/beta-banner' }}

This section gives you reference information about Tanzu Supply Chain APIs.

Tanzu Supply Chain introduces two concrete resources and two Duck-typed resources to your Kubernetes cluster.
The concrete resources are:

* SupplyChain - used to describe a path to production, and describe the [Workload] resource that users can
  consume to run this supply chain.
* [Component] - used to describe a reusable operation to apply to source, images, configuration and other artifacts.

The *Duck-typed resources* are:

* [Workload] - this resource CRD is created on cluster when a valid supply chain is applied. This is the API
  your SupplyChain describes for users to consume.
* [WorkloadRun] - a single attempt to deliver the [Workload] through a SupplyChain. Every time there's new configuration or external inputs to a workload, a run is
  generated.

The [Workload] and [WorkloadRun] are described as *Duck-Type resources* because their
final names and CRD are described by the SupplyChain and [Components] when applied
to the cluster. Many fields of each CRD are the same across the system.
