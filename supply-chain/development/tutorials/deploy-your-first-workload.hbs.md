# Tutorial: Deploy your first Workload

{{> 'partials/supply-chain/beta-banner' }} 

In this section, we will be using the `workload` CLI plugin for developers to create our first `Workload`. Our Platform Engineer has created some Supply Chains for us to use, which can pull the source code from our source repository, build it and the built artifact will be shipped to a GitOps repository of Platform Engineer's choice.

## Prequisites
You will need the following CLI tools installed on your local machine:

* [Tanzu CLI](../../../install-tanzu-cli.hbs.md#install-tanzu-cli)
* [**workload** Tanzu CLI plugin](../how-to/install-the-cli.hbs.md)

## Getting Started

As a developer, the first thing we want to know is what `SupplyChain` are available to us, and what kinds of `Workloads` we can create, that would trigger those `SupplyChain`. You can run the following `tanzu workload` command to get the list:

```
$ tanzu workload kind list

 KIND                                       VERSION   DESCRIPTION                                                                       
  appbuildv1s.supplychains.tanzu.vmware.com  v1alpha1  Supply chain that pulls the source code from git repo, builds it using            
                                                       buildpacks and package the output as Carvel package.                              

ðŸ”Ž To generate a workload for one of these kinds, use 'tanzu workload generate'
```

The command output shows that we have a kind `appbuildv1s.supplychains.tanzu.vmware.com` that we can use to generate our workload. The CLI also shows a hint on the next command to use in the process. Let's use the `tanzu workload generate` command to build our workload. We will be using the sample app [tanzu-java-web-app](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/tanzu-java-web-app) for this tutorial.
