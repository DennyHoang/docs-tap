Application Live View must run with a custom SecurityContextConstraint (SCC) to enable compliance with restricted Kubernetes Pod Security Standards on Openshift. The following SCC is configured for Application Live View Backend, Application Live View Connector, and Application Live View Convention Service when `kubernetes_distribution: openshift` is set in tap-values.yaml.

The following is a `SecurityContextConstraints` specification for Application Live View Connector:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: security.openshift.io/v1
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  name: appliveview-connector-restricted-with-seccomp
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: false
allowHostIPC: false
allowHostNetwork: false
allowHostPID: false
allowHostPorts: false
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
allowPrivilegedContainer: false
allowedCapabilities: null
defaultAddCapabilities: null
fsGroup:
  type: MustRunAs
priority: null
readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
requiredDropCapabilities:
  - ALL
runAsUser:
  type: MustRunAsNonRoot
seLinuxContext:
  type: MustRunAs
supplementalGroups:
  type: RunAsAny
volumes:
  - configMap
  - downwardAPI
  - emptyDir
  - persistentVolumeClaim
  - projected
  - secret
seccompProfiles:
  - runtime/default
```

The preceding `SecurityContextConstraints` specification is applicable to Application Live View Backend and Application Live View Convention Service as well.
